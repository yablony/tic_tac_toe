- How to play:
1. Get a friend and take turns putting :fried_shrimp: and :dumpling: on the OG Tic Tac Toe 3x3 grid.
2. Once the game is over you'll know the winner of the round or if it's a draw.
3. Use the 'Restart Game' button to start a new round.
4. The game will keep count of the game rounds (menu courses), as well as your wins.
5. Have fun with it!
