A game of Tic Tac Toe built by me in Yum Cha style.

## :page_facing_up: About
- How to play:
1. Get a friend and take turns putting :fried_shrimp: and :dumpling: on the OG Tic Tac Toe 3x3 grid.
2. Once the game is over you'll know the winner of the round or if it's a draw.
3. Use the 'Restart Game' button to start a new round.
4. The game will keep count of the game rounds (menu courses), as well as your wins.
5. Have fun with it!

- Add in-app screenshots.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
Writing out what I was about to do instead of just doing it was very helpful.I started off by dotting down the key requirements of the MVP that I'll have to meet, which were then integrated into a plan. I seperated the MVP into three stages: 
1. Write the HTML.
2. Write CSS.
3. Write JS.

JS took the largest chunk of my time, which I further seperated into the following two tasks:
1. Create a function to take turns that doesn’t allow players click more than once on a grid's square.
2. Write if statements to determine a winner and if it’s a draw.

After writing out exactly how I would achieve each of the above I was able to go forward and start writing my code, fixing any bugs that came up along the way.

### Post-MVP
After the MVP was delivered I decided to add more features to the game with the remaining time: 
1. A button that resets the game.
2. A game tracker that will count game rounds and the players' wins. 

I also played around with the CSS by adding a background picture and replacing the original images of crosses and noughts with fried shrimps and dumplings!

## :rocket: Cool tech
- JS, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation
- Libraries
- Animation
- Anythinhg else you'd be proud to show your parents

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Couldn't use external libraries, such as Bootstrap due to contradisctions
- Anything a LOT broken
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- Planning is important for the wellbeing of the code, as well as my mental wellbeing
- What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- A feature that allows a player to enter their name 
- A feature that allows a player to pick a Yum Cha food to play with instead of only fried shrimp and dumpling
- Sound effects for game immersion: player clicks and background music
